------------------------------
In the initial days of SharePoint 2010, Brian Pendergrass developed a ‘Search’ collection script designed to capture critical Farm information and Search Topology details. Over subsequent years, this script underwent adaptations to align with SharePoint 2013, 2016, and 2019 environments, with a specific emphasis on search-related components. As part of this evolution, ‘search health checks’ were incorporated to offer a comprehensive overview of our customers’ farms and search topologies.
